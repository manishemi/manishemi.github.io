The Word2Vec is an algorithm that can find similarities and differences from words in NLP(Natural Language Processing) task. The Word2Vec algorithm represents words in vector space, with word vectors we can easily find similarities or dissimilarities using distance measures(such as [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance))
