Reinforcement Learning(also called RL) is another learning algorithm that can learn to act appropriately in a specific environment. The RL algorithm is based on five parts.

| Figure 1 : RL parts|


## Parts

1 - Agent: An agent is an actor in the environment that can take actions, for instance as you can see in Figure 1 the dog is an agent

2 - Environmnet: Environmnet is place that the agent exist and operates

3 - Actions(Action space): Action space is a set of possible actions that the agent can make(The action space can be discrete or continuous)

4 - Oobservation: Observation is how the Environment interact back with the Agent and the agent can observe where Environment it is and how its action affected the Environment

5 - Reward: Reward is a scale for the success or failure of an agent's action. For example, if the dog(Agent) returns the bone will take food,  otherwise won't take anything

We have also two kinds of learing algorithm in RL:

1 - Value Learning

2 - Policy Learning
