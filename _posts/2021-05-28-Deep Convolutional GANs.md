Deep Convolutional GAN is a kind of [GAN](https://manishemirani.github.io/Generative-Adversarial-Networks/) network, which is using convolution network in the Generator and the Discriminator.


# How are the Convolutions network work?
Convolution networks are based on the Convolution layer which has trainable filters. These filters(matrices) has a smaller dimension than input data(input matrices), they multiply to input data and create an output that has less dimension of the input matrix.

Filters(kernels) have two base part:

1 - Size, which defines kernel size(e.g 3Ã—3)

2 - Strides, which defines step per each multiply(in Figure 1 it's 1, steps start from the center of each kernel)
