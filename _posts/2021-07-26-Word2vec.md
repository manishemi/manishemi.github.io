The Word2Vec is an algorithm that can find similarities and differences from words in NLP(Natural Language Processing) task. With word vectors we can easily find similarities or dissimilarities using distance measures(such as [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)).

But how we can represnt words in vector space?
